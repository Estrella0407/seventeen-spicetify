# Seventeen Spicetify Snippet
Hi, CaratsðŸ©· I was searching through [Spicetify Marketplace](https://github.com/spicetify/marketplace) and couldn't find anything that was dedicated to Seventeen. Therefore, I decided to create some snippets myself!

<br>

There are **two** separate file of snippets:
1. Seventeen Playback Bar
2. Seventeen Members Dancing on Playback Bar (*Hyung Line on Left, Dongsaeng Line on Right*)
